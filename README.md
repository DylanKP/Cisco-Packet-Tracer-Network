# Cisco-Packet-Tracer-Network
Simple Cisco Packet Tracer Network.
This project involves designing and simulating a secure communication network for a mid-sized company, addressing the challenges of network expansion while ensuring high availability, security, and performance. Key elements of the project include:

    Network Design & Subnetting:
    Developed a detailed network diagram and an efficient IP addressing scheme based on the 172.64.0.0/16 network. Justifications for design choices were provided to ensure scalability and optimal resource allocation.

    Network Simulation:
    Implemented a functional network simulation using tools such as Packet Tracer. The simulation demonstrated connectivity between various devices, validating the networkâ€™s functionality and design.
